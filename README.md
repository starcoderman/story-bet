Story bet!

StoryBet is an excitingly simple gambling game built on Monaco protocol!

Every 24 hours a new topic and outcome prediction for a story comes out. The stories can be fun and exciting such as "Will the invaders take over the castle" featuring a fictional story of the siege of a castle.

Every 15 minutes, 2 more lines come out of the story, and the betting is on!

Players who think that X event is going to happen bet yes, and others bet no.

At the end of 24 hours the story concludes and the market is resolved.

It's a super fun but incredibly simple game, and we would love to move it to mainnet in the future, build in non web3 features so that non-web3 users can bet and play, and advertise it like crazy!
